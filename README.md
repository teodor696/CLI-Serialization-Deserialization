# CLI-Serialization-Deserialization

Mini-guide to install the program on your pc:
1.Run 'npm i' in the console, on root level of my-cli-tool folder
2.Run 'npm install -g .'  in the console, on root level of my-cli-tool folder
3.The command 'appolica' is ready to run on your pc.

Command example: 'appolica i C:\Users\Somebody\Desktop\Folder\index.txt'

With command 'appolica i <somefilepath>' you declare you are going to write and serialize some text.\n
With command 'appolica o <somefilepath>' you declare you are going to deserialize that file. 

The program works 100% for empty .md and .txt files. There is index.txt file you can use for the test if you want.
